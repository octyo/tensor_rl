def DP_stochastic(model: DPModel) -> tuple[list[dict], list[dict]]: 
    r"""
    Implement the stochastic DP algorithm. The implementation follows (Her25, Algorithm 1).
    Once you are done, you should be able to call the function as:

    .. runblock:: pycon

        >>> from rl_course.ex02.deterministic_inventory import DeterministicInventoryDPModel
        >>> from rl_course.ex02.dp import DP_stochastic
        >>> model = DeterministicInventoryDPModel()  # Instantiate the deterministic DP model
        >>> J, pi = DP_stochastic(model)
        >>> print(pi[0][2]) # Action taken in state ``x_0=2`` at time step ``k=0``.

    :param model: An instance of :class:`rl_course.ex02.dp_model.DPModel` class. This represents the problem we wish to solve.
    :return:
        - ``J`` - A list of of cost function so that ``J[k][x]`` represents :math:`J_k(x)`
        - ``pi`` - A list of dictionaries so that ``pi[k][x]`` represents :math:`\mu_k(x)`
    """

    r""" 
    In case you run into problems, I recommend following the hints in (Her25, Subsection 6.2.1) and focus on the
    case without a noise term; once it works, you can add the w-terms. When you don't loop over noise terms, just specify
    them as w = None in env.f and env.g.

    J = [{} for _ in range(N + 1)]
    pi = [{} for _ in range(N)]
    J[N] = {x: model.gN(x) for x in model.S(model.N)}
    for k in range(N-1, -1, -1):

            r"""
            Update pi[k][x] and Jstar[k][x] using the general DP algorithm given in (Her25, Algorithm 1).
            If you implement it using the pseudo-code, I recommend you define Q (from the algorithm) as a dictionary like the J-function such that
                        
            > Q[u] = Q_u (for all u in model.A(x,k))
            
            Then you find the u with the lowest value of Q_u, i.e. 
            
            > umin = arg_min_u Q[u]
            
            (for help, google: `python find key in dictionary with minimum value').
            Then you can use this to update J[k][x] = Q_umin and pi[k][x] = umin.

            umin = min(Qu, key=Qu.get)
