    Implement policy iteration (see (SB18, Section 4.3)).

    as a dictionary (similar to the DP-problem in week 2!) so that

        Hints:
            * In the algorithm in (SB18), you need to perform an argmax_a over what is actually Q-values. The function
            value_function2q_function(mdp, s, gamma, V) can compute these. 
            * The argmax itself, assuming you follow the above procedure, involves a dictionary. It can be computed 
            using methods similar to those we saw in week2 of the DP problem.
            It is not a coincidence these algorithms are very similar -- if you think about it, the maximization step closely resembles the DP algorithm!
