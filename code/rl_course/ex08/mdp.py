class MDP: 
    r"""
    This class represents a Markov Decision Process. It defines three main components:
    - The actions available in a given state :math:`A(s)`
    - The transition probabilities :math:`p(s', r | s, a)`
    - A terminal check to determine if a state :math:`s` is terminal
    - A way to specify the initial state:

      - As a single state the MDP always begins in (most common)
      - As a general distribution :math:`p(s_0)`.

    In addition to this it allows you to access either
    - The set of all states (including terminal states) as ``mdp.states``
    - The set of all non-terminal states as ``mdp.non_terminal_states``

    .. note::
        The ``states`` and ``non_termianl_states`` are computed lazily. This means that if you don't access them, they won't use memory.
        This allows you to specify MDPs with an infinite number of states without running out of memory.

        reward ``r2``) given we are in state ``state`` and take action ``action``:
