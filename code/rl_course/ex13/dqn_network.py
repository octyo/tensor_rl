class DQNNetwork:
    """
    A class representing a deep Q network.
    Note that this function is batched. I.e. ``s`` is assumed to be a numpy array of dimension ``batch_size x n``

    The following example shows how you can evaluate the Q-values in a given state. An example:

    .. runblock:: pycon

        >>> from rl_course.ex13.torch_networks import TorchNetwork
        >>> import gymnasium as gym
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
        >>> Q = TorchNetwork(env, trainable=True, learning_rate=0.001) # DQN network requires an env to set network dimensions
        >>> batch_size = 32 # As an example
        >>> states = np.random.rand(batch_size, env.observation_space.shape[0]) # Creates some dummy input
        >>> states.shape    # batch_size x n
        >>> qvals = Q(states) # Evaluate Q(s,a)
        >>> qvals.shape # This is a tensor of dimension batch_size x actions
        >>> print(qvals[0,1]) # Get Q(s_0, 1)
        >>> Y = np.random.rand(batch_size, env.action_space.n) # Generate target Q-values (training data)
        >>> Q.fit(states, Y)                      # Train the Q-network for 1 gradient descent step

        r"""
        Update (adapts) the weights in this network towards those in source by a small amount.

        For each weight :math:`w_i` in (this) network, and each corresponding weight :math:`w'_i` in the ``source`` network,
        the following Polyak update is performed:
