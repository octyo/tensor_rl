    """The ChessTournament gymnasium-environment which simulate a chess tournament.

    In the problem, a chess tournament ends when a player wins two games in a row. The results
    of each game are -1, 0, 1 corresponding to a loss, draw and win for player 1. See:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UQU1oBpAic

    To implement this, we define the step-function such that one episode of the environment corresponds to playing
    a chess tournament to completion. Once the environment completes, it returns a reward of +1 if the player won
    the tournament, and otherwise 0.

    Each step therefore corresponds to playing a single game in the tournament.
    To implement this, we use a state corresponding to the sequence of games in the tournament:

    >>> self.s = [0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

    In the self.step(action)-function, we ignore the action, simulate the outcome of a single game,
    and append the outcome to self.s. We then compute whether the tournament has completed, and if so
    a reward of 1 if we won.
